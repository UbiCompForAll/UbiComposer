SimpleLanguage Android

The files in this project are generated from the EMF models in the projects:
org.ubicompforall.descriptor using the descriptor_android.genmodel and
org.ubicompforall.simplelanguage using the SimpleLanguage_android.genmodel .
This project with the generated files are provided as a convenience, as
it makes it easier to build other dependent Android project without 
requiring to invoice the generation from EMF models manually.

This software was developed in the UbiCompForAll project,
